# Issues with pynput #
######################

1. After returning to the main menu after performing an action,
   pressing Esc to exit the program throws a bunch of errors 
   after exiting the program and sometimes even crashes it.
   It seems to be an issue with Listener, but I haven't been 
   able to figure it out.

2. When practicing a flashcard deck, the user presses the shift
   key to advance to the back of the card, and then to the next
   card. This works as intended, however, pressing any other key
   automatically advances to the next card without showing the
   the back of the previous card.

# Issue with pykakasi #
#######################

1. Due to the nature of kanji having many different readings,
   the hiragana and romaji readings listed after a word has been
   searched can be wrong. This is one of the main reasons why the
   user is not recommended to convert their word during the initial
   search, as it can produce an incorrect reading there as well.
   This could possibly be fixed by scraping a website designed to
   produce accurate conversions from kanji -> hiragana/katakana,
   but I could not find one that did so, and if that were implemented,
   load times would be negatively affected due to having to download
   yet another website's HTML. Developing a new library for conversion
   is probably the best option.
