# Japanese Dictionary
Created By Tyler Freberg
CS 499 Senior Seminar Project

One of my main areas of study outside of computer science is the Japanese language. I have been learning for a few years now. Because of this, I thought itâ€™d be a good idea to combine both computer science and Japanese into one: a simple Japanese dictionary.
The idea is to take a Japanese word as input and give information relating to that word, including but not limited to definition and example sentences. The program will be built in Python, and my plan is to either use a web scraper such as Beautiful Soup in combination with Jisho.org to scrape the HTML contents for the desired information, or to use an API to get the information needed.
In addition to the dictionary, I want to also implement an option to make and practice flashcards for desired words.

Week 1: Learn how to efficiently use a web scraper/get information from an API
Week 2: Implement a basic use of either method to get test information from Japanese to English
Week 3: Finalize what information should be pulled when searching: definition, sentences, etc.
Week 4: Implement English to Japanese
Week 5: Implement basic flashcard system
Week 6: Finalize UI: formatting, program options for users, etc.
Week 7: Clean up, testing
